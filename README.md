# Red Hat OpenShift AI - GitOps Repository

This repository provides a GitOps-based approach to deploying and managing Red Hat OpenShift AI and its dependencies using Kustomize. It serves as a standardized, repeatable, and automated way to configure the complete OpenShift AI stack.

## Overview

This repository addresses OpenShift AI dependencies that are treated as **administrator-owned resources**. It provides a template for deploying these prerequisites in a standardized way, simplifying the administrator's workflow by providing a single source of truth for the entire OpenShift AI stack.

This repository works with both GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux, etc.) and `oc` or `kubectl` CLI.

### How the Structure Works

The repository is designed to be applied in **layers**, providing flexibility in deployment:

1. **Granular Installation**: Each dependency or component has its own `kustomization.yaml` and can be applied independently.
2. **Grouped Installation**: Top-level folders contain `kustomization.yaml` files that include all items within them.
3. **Composition**: Each component is self-contained and includes its required dependencies.

### Dependencies

| Operator | Purpose | Namespace | Required By | Requires Operators |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cert-Manager** | Certificate management and TLS provisioning | `cert-manager-operator` | Model Serving (Kueue, Ray) | |
| **Kueue** | Job queue for distributed workloads | `openshift-kueue-operator` | Model Serving (Ray), Trainer | Cert-Manager |
| **Cluster Observability Operator** | Cluster observability and monitoring | `openshift-cluster-observability-operator` | Monitoring | |

#### Adding New Dependencies

To add a new dependency, follow the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-dependency-operator) guide.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster (version 4.19 or later)
- `kubectl` or `oc` CLI installed
- Cluster admin permissions
- Kustomize v5 or later (optional - `kubectl` has built-in Kustomize support)

### Basic Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davidebianchi/rhoai-gitops.git
cd rhoai-gitops

# 2. Check out the branch matching your OpenShift AI version
git checkout rhoai-3.0

# 3. Install all dependencies
kubectl apply -k dependencies

# 4. Wait for operators to be ready
```

## Installation Methods

### Install All Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
kubectl apply -k dependencies
```

### Install Specific Dependencies

```bash
kubectl apply -k dependencies/operators/cert-manager
kubectl apply -k dependencies/operators/kueue-operator
```

### Install a Subset of Dependencies

You can modify `dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml` to comment out dependencies you don't need.
For example, if the Kueue operator is not needed, comment it out like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

components:
  - ../../components/operators/cert-manager
  # - ../../components/operators/kueue-operator
```

If you need the Kueue operator later, uncomment it and apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -k dependencies/operators
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Administrators

1. **Fork or Clone** this repository as a starting point for your organization
2. **Select the Branch** matching your target OpenShift AI version (e.g., `rhoai-3.0`)
3. **Customize** the configurations for your specific environment
4. **Test** thoroughly in a non-production environment
5. **Maintain** your fork with updates and customizations
6. **Apply** using your GitOps tool (ArgoCD, Flux, etc.) or `kubectl`

## Release Strategy

- **No Formal Releases**: This repository does not have official releases. Users are expected to clone or fork the repository and use it as a basis for their own configurations.
- **Branch per OpenShift AI Version**: Each version of OpenShift AI has a dedicated branch (e.g., `rhoai-3.0`, `rhoai-3.1`) to ensure compatibility.
- **Version Selection**: Always select the branch that corresponds to your target OpenShift AI version.
