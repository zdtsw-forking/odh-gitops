## Overview

This repository addresses OpenDataHub dependencies that are treated as **administrator-owned resources**. It provides a template for deploying these prerequisites in a standardized way, simplifying the administrator's workflow by providing a single source of truth for the entire OpenDataHub stack.

This repository works with GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux, etc.).

### How the Structure Works

The repository is designed to be applied in **layers**, providing flexibility in deployment:

1. **Granular Installation**: Each dependency or component has its own `kustomization.yaml` and can be applied independently.
2. **Grouped Installation**: Top-level folders contain `kustomization.yaml` files that include all items within them.
3. **Composition**: Each component is self-contained and includes its required dependencies.

### Dependencies

| Operator                           | Purpose                                     | Namespace | Used By                  | Operators Required |

#### Operator Configuration Requirements

Some operators require additional configuration. Below are the configuration requirements for each operator:

##### Red Hat Connectivity Link operator

Additional configuration is needed to enable TLS for Authorino. This is done in two stages:

###### Stage 1: Deploy base configuration

1. Apply RHCL base configuration (no TLS enabled):
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k configurations/rhcl-operator
   ```

2. Verify that Kuadrant CR and Authorino CR exist and are Ready:
   ```bash
   kubectl get kuadrant -n <kuadrant-namespace>
   kubectl get authorino -n <kuadrant-namespace>
   ```

###### Stage 2: Enable TLS

3. Run the preparation script to annotate the Service, generate the TLS certificate Secret, and update the kustomization.yaml for RHCL:
   ```bash
   make prepare-authorino-tls KUADRANT_NS=<kuadrant-namespace>
   ```

4. Re-apply the configuration to enable TLS for Authorino:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k configurations/rhcl-operator
   ```

5. Verify that Authorino has TLS enabled:
   ```bash
   kubectl get authorino authorino -n <kuadrant-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.listener.tls}'
   ```

#### Adding New Dependencies

To add a new dependency, follow the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-dependency-operator) guide.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster (version 4.19 or later)
- `kubectl` or `oc` CLI installed
- Cluster admin permissions
- Kustomize v5 or later (optional - `kubectl` has built-in Kustomize support)

## Installation Methods

### Installation instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-gitops.git
cd odh-gitops

# 2. Modify as needed

# 3. Follow the desired tool installation instructions,
#    using the correct branch matching your desired
#    OpenDataHub version (e.g. odh-3.0)
```

### Installation with ArgoCD

#### Prerequisites

- ArgoCD installed
- Cluster admin permissions
- The ArgoCD instance needs permissions to handle cluster configuration. Follow [this documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_gitops/1.19/html/declarative_cluster_configuration/configuring-an-openshift-cluster-by-deploying-an-application-with-cluster-configurations#gitops-additional-permissions-for-cluster-config_configuring-an-openshift-cluster-by-deploying-an-application-with-cluster-configurations). Additional permissions needed are:
  - all actions on kueues.kueue.openshift.io
  - all actions on kuadrants.kuadrant.io

#### Installation instructions

To install the repository with ArgoCD, create a new ArgoCD application and point it to the repository with the desired branch.
To ensure it will work, since it uses custom resources whose definitions are installed by the operators by OLM in a second step, you need to skip dry run on missing resources in the Application resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  syncPolicy:
      syncOptions:
        - SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
```

#### Install All Dependencies

Create an application, setting the sync policy to skip dry run on missing resources, and point to the base directory `kustomization.yaml`.
In this way, all dependencies will be installed automatically.

#### Install Specific Dependencies

To install specific dependencies, open [`dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml`](dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml) and comment out the dependencies you don't need.
Do the same for [`configurations/kustomization.yaml`](configurations/kustomization.yaml).

For example, if the Kueue operator is not needed, comment it out like this in [`dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml`](dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

components:
  - ../../components/operators/cert-manager
  # - ../../components/operators/kueue-operator
```

After that, setup the application to point to the base directory `kustomization.yaml` file.

### Installation with CLI

#### Install All Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
kubectl apply -k dependencies

# Wait some seconds to let the operators install

# Install operator configurations
kubectl apply -k configurations
```

### Install Specific Dependencies

```bash
kubectl apply -k dependencies/operators/cert-manager
kubectl apply -k dependencies/operators/kueue-operator

# Wait some seconds to let the operators install

# Install specific operator configurations
kubectl apply -k configurations/kueue-operator
```

### Install a Subset of Dependencies

You can modify `dependencies/operators/kustomization.yaml` to comment out dependencies you don't need.
For example, if the Kueue operator is not needed, comment it out like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

components:
  - ../../components/operators/cert-manager
  # - ../../components/operators/kueue-operator
```

If you need the Kueue operator later, uncomment it and apply the changes:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
kubectl apply -k dependencies/

# Install the operator configurations
kubectl apply -k configurations/
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Administrators

1. **Fork or Clone** this repository as a starting point for your organization
2. **Select the Branch** matching your target OpenDataHub version (e.g., `odh-3.0`)
3. **Customize** the configurations for your specific environment
4. **Test** thoroughly in a non-production environment
5. **Maintain** your fork with updates and customizations
6. **Apply** using your GitOps tool (ArgoCD, Flux, etc.) or `kubectl`

## Release Strategy

- **No Formal Releases**: This repository does not have official releases. Users are expected to clone or fork the repository and use it as a basis for their own configurations.
- **Branch per OpenDataHub Version**: Each version of OpenDataHub has a dedicated branch (e.g., `odh-3.0`, `odh-3.1`) to ensure compatibility.
- **Version Selection**: Always select the branch that corresponds to your target OpenDataHub version.
