# RHOAI Dependencies Helm Chart

A Helm chart for installing ODH/RHOAI dependencies and component configurations on OpenShift.

## Overview

This chart provides a flexible way to install the operators and configurations required by OpenShift AI (RHOAI) and Open Data Hub (ODH). It supports:

- **Component-based installation**: Enable high-level components (kserve, kueue, aipipelines, ...) and their dependencies are automatically installed
- **Tri-state dependency management**: Dependencies can be `auto` (install if needed), `true` (always install), or `false` (skip - user has it already)
- **OLM installation**: Operators are installed via Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
- **Idempotent installation**: Run the same command multiple times until all resources are applied

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies with default settings. We need to install the dependencies before the operator is installed.
helm upgrade --install rhoai ./chart -n opendatahub-gitops --create-namespace

# Wait for CRDs to be created, then run again to create CRs
helm upgrade --install rhoai ./chart -n opendatahub-gitops
```

## Installation Flow

Due to CRD dependencies (operators create CRDs that are needed for CR resources), installation requires multiple runs:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  helm upgrade --install rhoai ./chart -n opendatahub-gitops --create-namespace
  sleep 60
done
```

**What happens:**
1. **First run**: Operators are installed via OLM (Namespace, OperatorGroup, Subscription). CRs are skipped because CRDs don't exist yet.
2. **Subsequent runs**: Once operators are ready and CRDs exist, CR configurations are created.
3. **Later runs**: Idempotent - no changes if everything is already deployed.

### Enable Authorino TLS

The Kuadrant operator creates the Authorino resource automatically. To enable TLS, use the provided script which:

1. Annotates the Authorino service to trigger TLS certificate generation
2. Waits for the TLS secret to be created
3. Patches the Authorino CR to enable TLS

```bash
# Run the script to enable TLS
KUSTOMIZE_MODE=false ./scripts/prepare-authorino-tls.sh
```

The script can be customized with environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KUADRANT_NS` | `kuadrant-system` | Namespace where Kuadrant is installed |
| `K8S_CLI` | `kubectl` | Kubernetes CLI to use (kubectl or oc) |
| `KUSTOMIZE_MODE` | `true` | If false, patches the Authorino CR directly instead of updating the kustomization.yaml |

> **Note**: The `dependencies.rhcl.config.tlsEnabled` Helm value is intended for ArgoCD use cases. For CLI use case, use the script above.

### Enable Models as Service

To enable Models as Service, Gateway and GatewayClass are needed. They could be created manually or with the chart.
To create them with the chart, you need to manually set the gateway hostname, and the certificate secret name.
By default, the Gateway creation is disabled. To enable it, you need to set the `components.kserve.modelsAsService.gateway.create`
and `components.kserve.modelsAsService.gatewayClass.create` to `true`.

For example, it is possible to enable Models as Service with the following values,
configuring correctly the `<HOSTNAME>`, `<SECRET_NAME>` and correctly define the `allowedRoutes`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kserve:
    modelsAsService:
      gatewayClass:
        create: true
      gateway:
        create: true
        spec:
          gatewayClassName: maas-gateway-class
          listeners:
            - name: https
              port: 443
              # hostname: <HOSTNAME> # Uncomment this line to use a specific hostname.
              protocol: HTTPS
              allowedRoutes:
                namespaces:
                  # The following is an example of how to restrict the namespaces to the interested ones.
                  from: Selector
                  selector:
                    matchExpressions:
                    - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
                      operator: In
                      values:
                      - openshift-ingress
                      - <LLM_INFERENCE_SERVICE_NAMESPACE>
              tls:
                certificateRefs:
                - group: ''
                  kind: Secret
                  name: <SECRET_NAME>
                mode: Terminate
```

## Configuration

### Operator

Choose between ODH (Open Data Hub) or RHOAI (Red Hat OpenShift AI) operator:

```yaml
operator:
  enabled: true
  type: rhoai  # odh | rhoai
```

| Type | Operator | Namespace | Source |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| `odh` | opendatahub-operator | openshift-operators | community-operators |
| `rhoai` | rhods-operator | redhat-ods-operator | redhat-operators |

### Components

High-level features that:

1. Configure the DataScienceCluster (DSC) `managementState`
2. Automatically enable their required dependencies when active (Managed or Unmanaged)

| managementState | Dependencies auto-enabled |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `Managed` | Yes |
| `Unmanaged` | Yes |
| `Removed` | No |

| Component | Description | Default State | Dependencies |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|

| `trustyai` | TrustyAI | Managed | - |
| `workbenches` | Workbenches | Managed | - |

### Dependencies

Operators that can be installed. Use tri-state `enabled` field:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `auto` | Install if required by an enabled component (default) |
| `true` | Always install |
| `false` | Never install (user has it already) |

| Dependency | Description | Own Dependencies |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| `certManager` | Cert Manager operator | - |
| `leaderWorkerSet` | Leader Worker Set operator | certManager |
| `jobSet` | Job Set operator | - |
| `rhcl` | RHCL (Kuadrant) operator | certManager, leaderWorkerSet |
| `kueue` | Kueue operator | certManager |
| `customMetricsAutoscaler` | Custom Metrics Autoscaler (KEDA) | - |
| `clusterObservability` | Cluster Observability operator | opentelemetry |
| `opentelemetry` | OpenTelemetry operator | - |
| `tempo` | Tempo operator | opentelemetry |
| `nfd` | Node Feature Discovery (required for GPU support) | - |
| `nvidiaGPUOperator` | NVIDIA GPU Operator (required for GPU support) | nfd |

### Example: Enable kserve

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kserve:
    # Dependencies are enabled by default, only specify to override
    # dependencies:
    #   certManager: true
    #   leaderWorkerSet: true
    #   jobSet: true
    #   rhcl: true
    #   customMetricsAutoscaler: true
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
# Dependencies certManager, leaderWorkerSet, jobSet, rhcl, customMetricsAutoscaler
# will be auto-installed because kserve is Managed
```

### Example: Skip a dependency you already have

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed

dependencies:
  certManager:
    enabled: false  # I already have cert-manager installed
```

### Example: Install a dependency without a component

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed

dependencies:
  certManager:
    enabled: true  # Force install even though no component needs it
```

### Example: Enable kueue with custom spec

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kueue:
    dsc:
      managementState: Unmanaged

dependencies:
  kueue:
    enabled: auto
    config:
      # spec accepts any fields supported by the Kueue CR
      spec:
        managementState: Managed
        config:
          integrations:
            frameworks:
              - Deployment
              - Pod
              - PyTorchJob
```

### Example: Enable RHCL with TLS

To enable TLS for Authorino, first deploy with kserve enabled:

```yaml
# values.yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed

dependencies:
  rhcl:
    enabled: auto
    config:
      # Kuadrant CR spec (optional)
      spec: {}
```

Then run the TLS preparation script after the Kuadrant operator has created the Authorino resource:

```bash
./scripts/prepare-authorino-tls.sh
```

## Values Reference

### Global Settings

```yaml
global:
  # Installation type (currently only olm is supported)
  installationType: olm
  
  # OLM settings
  olm:
    installPlanApproval: Automatic
    source: redhat-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  
  # Common labels for all resources
  labels: {}
```

### Components

Components configure the DataScienceCluster (DSC) and trigger automatic dependency installation.

```yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dependencies:
      certManager: true       # explicitly enable (same as default)
      customMetricsAutoscaler: false  # disable this dependency for kserve
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed  # Managed | Removed
      rawDeploymentServiceConfig: Headless  # Headless | Headed
      nim:
        managementState: Managed  # NVIDIA NIM integration

  kueue:
    dsc:
      managementState: Unmanaged  # Unmanaged | Removed

  aipipelines:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed  # Managed | Removed

  modelregistry:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
      registriesNamespace: my-custom-namespace  # overrides operator-type default

  workbenches:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
      workbenchNamespace: my-workbench-ns  # overrides operator-type default
```

When `managementState` is `Managed` or `Unmanaged`, the component's dependencies are auto-enabled. When `Removed`, they are not.

Components with operator-type-specific defaults (like `modelregistry` and `workbenches`) will use appropriate namespace values based on whether you're using `odh` or `rhoai` operator type, unless explicitly overridden.

#### How Component Dependencies Work

Each component has a `dependencies` map with **boolean toggles** that control which operators the component will trigger for installation. Dependencies can be required or optional - set them to `false` if you don't need a specific feature.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `true` | Enable this dependency for the component (default for listed deps) |
| `false` | Disable this dependency - won't be installed for this component |

This is different from the top-level `dependencies.<name>.enabled` field which uses tri-state (`auto`/`true`/`false`).

**The dependency resolution flow:**

1. Component is active (managementState = `Managed` or `Unmanaged`)
2. Component's `dependencies.<dep>` is `true` (or not set, using default)
3. Top-level `dependencies.<dep>.enabled` is `auto` or `true`
4. → Dependency operator gets installed

**Example**: Disable an optional dependency you don't need:

```yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dependencies:
      customMetricsAutoscaler: false  # don't need autoscaling, skip KEDA
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
# certManager, leaderWorkerSet, jobSet, rhcl will still be auto-installed
# customMetricsAutoscaler will NOT be installed (unless another component needs it)
```

**Example**: You already have cert-manager pre-installed:

```yaml
components:
  kserve:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed

dependencies:
  certManager:
    enabled: false  # skip installation, I already have it
```

### Dependencies

To configure dependencies, refer to the [api docs](api-docs.md).

## ArgoCD Usage

This chart works with ArgoCD but requires specific configuration:

### Why `skipCrdCheck: true` is required

ArgoCD renders Helm templates **without cluster access**, so the `lookup` function (used to check if CRDs exist) always returns empty results. You must set `global.skipCrdCheck: true` to render all CRs upfront.

### Why `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource` is required

ArgoCD performs dry-run validation before applying resources. CRs whose CRDs don't exist yet will fail validation. The `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` sync option skips dry-run for these resources.

### Example ArgoCD Application

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: rhoai-dependencies
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/your-org/odh-gitops
    targetRevision: main
    path: chart
    helm:
      values: |
        global:
          skipCrdCheck: true
        components:
          kserve:
            managementState: Managed
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: rhoai-system
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
```

ArgoCD automatically retries failed resources, so after operators install their CRDs, subsequent syncs will successfully apply the CRs.

### Enable Authorino TLS in ArgoCD

Since the Kuadrant operator automatically creates the Authorino resource, enabling TLS requires a manual step:

```bash
kubectl annotate svc/authorino-authorino-authorization \
    service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=authorino-server-cert \
    -n kuadrant-system
```

Once the secret is created, set `dependencies.rhcl.config.tlsEnabled` to `true` in the ArgoCD application values.

## Troubleshooting

### CRs not being created

If CR resources (Kueue, Kuadrant, etc.) are not being created:

1. Check if the operator is installed and ready:
   ```bash
   kubectl get csv -A | grep kueue
   ```

2. Check if the CRD exists:
   ```bash
   kubectl get crd kueues.kueue.openshift.io
   ```

3. Run `helm upgrade` again - CRs are skipped until CRDs exist.

### Dependency not being installed

If a dependency is not being installed:

1. Check if the component that requires it is enabled
2. Check if the dependency is explicitly set to `false`
3. Verify the dependency is in the component's dependency map

### Upgrade fails because object fields are modified

If you see the following error:

```txt
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: conflict occurred while applying object ...
```

It is an Helm Server-Side Apply (SSA) field ownership issue. The error indicates that Helm is trying to update a field that is not owned by the Helm chart.
To fix it, you can force conflicts resolution by adding the `--force-conflicts` flag to the helm upgrade command.
